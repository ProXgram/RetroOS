# RetroOS

This is my first repository created to harbor my first hobby OS.

The name of the operating system is not yet chosen upon, therefore it is defaulted to RetroOS.

RetroOS seeks to be a modern x86-64 OS written in C with a retro style to it, restoring the golden era of operating systems
with a nostalgic feel and a focus on simplicity.
